# Onboard - Tenant Onboarding Framework

Onboard is a tenant onboarding framework made for software as a service (SaaS) applications. 
Onboard eases the setup of a minimal SaaS onboarding. Onboard is built in NextJS (Frontend) and Go (Backend) 
and on default uses PostgreSQL for the database, Terraform for infrastructure deployment.

Onboarding is the process of introducing a new tenant into the environment of an SaaS application.

As the framework is still in development, this README page will always be updated.
